# Automation Scenarios
This repository is maintained by eramba limited (www.eramba.org), we provide sample automation scripts that can be used mainly for Internal Control Automation.

The directory structure used is Connector_Platform/Scenario, for example:

- AWS/Accounts_use_MFA
- AWS/EC2_has_backup_policy_enforced
- AWS/EBS_uses_encryption
- Zoom/Accounts_use_MFA
- Etc

Once you enter a folder you will find a Readme.md file that describes:

- Brief Objective of the Script
- Platform Supported
- Configuration Settings
  - Authentication Parameters
  - Evidence Collected
  - Analysis Performed
  - Analysis Output Format
