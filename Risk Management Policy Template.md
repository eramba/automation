# Risk Management Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes the framework for managing cybersecurity and information security risks. Its goal is to ensure that risks are systematically identified, evaluated, treated, monitored, and communicated.

## Scope
This policy applies to [template: scope].

## Responsibilities
The [template: CISO or Information Security Manager] is responsible for maintaining the risk management framework and ensuring that risk assessments and treatments are conducted according to this policy.  
The GRC team is responsible for coordinating the risk assessment process, maintaining risk registers, and facilitating communication between departments.  
Department heads are responsible for identifying, assessing, and managing risks within their respective areas, in collaboration with the GRC team.  
The executive management team is responsible for reviewing and approving high-level risks, monitoring residual risks, and ensuring alignment with organisational objectives.  
All employees are responsible for reporting potential risks or incidents that may affect the organisation’s operations, systems, or compliance obligations.

## Risk Classification
Risks are evaluated using an Impact × Likelihood model. Each risk is assigned a score based on the combination of its Impact and Likelihood ratings.

### Impact Levels
Impact reflects the potential effect a risk event could have within the defined scope.

| Impact Level | Description | Score |
|---------------|--------------|-------|
| High | A risk event could cause major disruption to the profitability of the organisation and/or result in serious legal consequences for its executives and shareholders. | 3 |
| Medium | A risk event could cause a noticeable impact to a specific department or service but can be managed without major business disruption. | 2 |
| Low | A risk event has minimal effect on operations or can be easily contained and remediated. | 1 |

### Likelihood Levels
Likelihood reflects the probability that a risk event may occur.

| Likelihood Level | Description | Score |
|------------------|--------------|-------|
| High | The event has occurred in the past and could happen again. | 3 |
| Medium | The event has not occurred in the past but could easily take place. | 2 |
| Low | The event has not occurred in the past and is unlikely to take place. | 1 |

### Risk Matrix
The overall Risk Rating is determined by combining the Impact and Likelihood scores using a standard 3×3 matrix. The matrix defines who must sign off on the Risk Treatment. There are always two parties involved for segregation of duties purposes.

|                   | Low Impact | Medium Impact | High Impact |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Low Likelihood | Low - GRC | Low - GRC | Medium - GRC + Manager |
| Medium Likelihood | Low - GRC | Medium - GRC + Manager | Medium - GRC + C-Level |
| High Likelihood | Medium - GRC + Manager | Medium - GRC + C-Level | High - GRC + C-Level |

## Risk Identification
Risks are identified through the following methods:

- Interviews and workshops with [template: department heads or key stakeholders]  
- Review of incidents, audit findings, and operational reports  
- Evaluation of new projects, systems, or regulatory requirements  
- These interviews must be recorded in the form of notes or video/audio recordings.

## Risk Analysis
Each identified risk is analyzed in order to establish its context, particularly regarding:

- Determining the likelihood and impact. The classification of the risk must be performed by the GRC team and the area that created the issue. In case of disagreement, their immediate superiors must be involved.  
- Identifying and (optionally) recording its associated threats and vulnerabilities.  
- Documenting relevant context such as [template: business owner, affected assets, etc.].

## Risk Treatment
The following risk treatment options exist, each requiring specific treatment activities:

- Accept: Requires at least a Risk Exception; optionally, it can include Projects.  
- Mitigate: Requires at least one or more Internal Controls and Policies.  
- Avoid: Requires at least a Risk Exception; optionally, it can include Projects.  
- Transfer: Requires at least a Risk Exception; optionally, it can include Projects.

All treatment decisions and residual risks must be documented and approved as defined in the Risk Matrix.

## Risk Communication and Approval
Risk results and treatment decisions are communicated and approved as follows:

- Annual risk reporting is presented to [template: C-Level executives and/or Risk Committee].

## Risk Reviews
Risk assessments and treatment plans are reviewed:

- Annually  
- Whenever major changes occur, including [template: relevant changes on the scope or any of its components]

The review must be conducted by those involved in the risk and as mandated in the Risk Matrix.
