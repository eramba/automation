# Information Security Awareness Policy

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all employees, contractors, and relevant third parties are aware of their responsibilities for maintaining information security. The objective is to reduce human-related security risks through education, training, and regular communication.

## Scope
This policy applies to [template: scope], including all permanent and temporary employees, contractors, and any other individuals who have access to [template: organisation_name]'s information systems or data.

## Responsibilities
The [template: Information Security Manager or CISO] is responsible for maintaining this policy, defining training content, and ensuring training completion and reporting.  
Department managers are responsible for ensuring that their team members complete the required trainings within the defined timelines.  
All employees, contractors, and third parties are responsible for actively participating in the awareness activities and applying the knowledge gained in their daily work.

## Trainings

### General Staff
All employees must complete a general Information Security Awareness training when joining the organisation.  
This training introduces basic cybersecurity principles, acceptable use, password management, phishing awareness, and how to report potential security incidents.

A refresher course must be completed every 12 months to ensure ongoing awareness and compliance with security practices.

### Finance Team
The Finance team must attend specific training sessions covering secure handling of financial data, fraud prevention, phishing threats, and regulatory compliance (such as data protection and financial regulations).  
This training is provided annually, with additional sessions if major financial system changes occur.

### IT Team
IT staff receive additional training on technical and procedural security measures, including system hardening, patch management, access control, and secure configuration standards.  
This training is conducted upon joining the team and refreshed annually or when significant technological or procedural changes occur.

### Software Development Team
Software development staff are required to complete training on secure software development practices. The training covers secure coding, input validation, dependency management, and vulnerability management in line with [template: development_framework].  
It is mandatory during onboarding and renewed every year, or whenever the development process undergoes major updates.

### HR Team

## Partners
[template: organisation_name] communicates its commitment to security awareness to partners, contractors, and customers.  
All contractors and third parties with access to organisational systems or data must receive appropriate security awareness information before being granted access.  
Customers and business partners are informed about [template: organisation_name]’s awareness and training initiatives through shared documentation, compliance communications, or during partnership onboarding.  
This approach ensures consistent security expectations and shared responsibility across the organisation’s ecosystem.

## Record Keeping
Records of completed trainings, awareness communications, and third-party acknowledgments are maintained in [template: training_system].  
These records serve as evidence of compliance and are reviewed at least annually as part of the information security management review process.
