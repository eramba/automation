# Risk Management Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes the framework for managing cybersecurity and information security risks across **[template: organisation name]**.

Its goal is to ensure that risks are systematically identified, evaluated, treated, and monitored to protect **[template: organisation name]**’s operations, information assets, and stakeholder trust.

---

## Scope
This policy applies to all departments under the **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** program and **[template: define additional departments or management roles included]**.

It covers all business processes, IT systems, and services related to **[template: describe the products, services, or platforms operated by the organisation]**.

---

## Risk Classification

Risks are evaluated using an **Impact × Likelihood** model.  
Each risk is assigned a score based on the combination of its **Impact** and **Likelihood** ratings.

---

### Impact Levels

Impact reflects the potential effect a risk event could have on **[template: organisation name]**.

| Impact Level | Description | Example Criteria *(adjust as needed)* |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| **High** | A risk event could cause major disruption to operations, significant financial loss, or regulatory penalties. | - Extended service downtime  <br> - Major data breach  <br> - Reputational damage |
| **Medium** | A risk event could cause noticeable impact to a specific department or service, but can be managed without major business disruption. | - Localized system outage  <br> - Moderate data exposure  <br> - Short-term financial or customer impact |
| **Low** | A risk event has minimal effect on operations or can be easily contained and remediated. | - Temporary inconvenience  <br> - Minor data error  <br> - Low-cost recovery |

[template: adjust descriptions and examples to align with the organisation’s risk appetite and impact scale.]

---

### Likelihood Levels

Likelihood reflects the probability that a risk event may occur within **[template: defined timeframe, e.g., 12 months]**.

| Likelihood Level | Description | Example Criteria *(adjust as needed)* |
|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| **High** | The event is expected to occur frequently or has occurred multiple times in recent years. | - Occurs several times a year  <br> - High exposure or weak control environment |
| **Medium** | The event could occur occasionally based on business or environmental conditions. | - Occurs once every few years  <br> - Some preventive controls exist |
| **Low** | The event is unlikely to occur or has never happened historically. | - Rare occurrence  <br> - Strong preventive controls |

[template: define probability or frequency thresholds based on the organisation’s methodology.]

---

### Risk Matrix

The overall **Risk Rating** is determined by combining the **Impact** and **Likelihood** scores using a standard 3×3 matrix.

|                   | **Low Impact** | **Medium Impact** | **High Impact** |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Low Likelihood** | Low | Low | Medium |
| **Medium Likelihood** | Low | Medium | High |
| **High Likelihood** | Medium | High | High |

[template: adjust the matrix layout or thresholds to reflect the organisation’s defined risk tolerance.]

---

## Risk Identification
Risks are identified through the following methods:

- Interviews and workshops with **[template: department heads or key stakeholders]**  
- Review of incidents, audit findings, and operational reports  
- Evaluation of new projects, systems, or regulatory requirements  

All identified risks are recorded in the **Risk Register** maintained by **[template: specify the responsible role or team]**.

---

## Risk Analysis
Each identified risk is analyzed in collaboration with **[template: define participants, e.g., department heads, ISMS Manager, GRC team]** to:

- Determine the likelihood and impact  
- Identify associated threats and vulnerabilities  
- Document relevant context such as **[template: business owner, affected assets, existing controls, etc.]**

---

## Risk Treatment
Once analyzed, risks are assigned a treatment plan chosen from the following options:

- **Accept** the risk when it falls within acceptable limits  
- **Mitigate** the risk through additional controls or safeguards  
- **Avoid** the risk by discontinuing the associated activity  
- **Transfer** the risk through outsourcing or insurance  

Risks deemed **High in Impact** must be mitigated.  
All treatment decisions and residual risks must be documented and approved by **[template: define approvers, e.g., GRC team, department managers, or management committee]**.

---

## Risk Communication and Approval
Risk results and treatment decisions are communicated and approved as follows:

- Annual risk reporting is presented to **[template: define top management roles or committees, e.g., C-Level executives or Risk Committee]**  
- All **High** and **Medium impact** risk treatments must be approved by **[template: specify approval authority]**  
- Significant unapproved or overdue risks must be escalated to **[template: specify escalation path, e.g., CEO, CISO, or Board]**

---

## Risk Reviews
Risk assessments and treatment plans are reviewed:

- **Annually**, during **[template: define review process or governance forum name, e.g., ISMS Management Review]**  
- **Whenever major changes occur**, including **[template: examples of triggers — new systems, services, or business processes]**

The purpose of each review is to ensure that treatments remain effective and that new risks are promptly identified.  
**[template: specify who conducts and approves the review.]**
