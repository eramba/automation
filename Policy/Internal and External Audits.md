# Internal and External Audits Policy

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for conducting internal and external audits to verify the effectiveness and continual improvement of [template: organisation_name]’s Information Security Management System (ISMS).  
Audits ensure that policies, controls, and procedures are correctly implemented, maintained, and aligned with applicable standards and regulatory requirements.

## Scope
This policy applies to [template: scope], covering all departments, processes, and systems included within the Information Security Management System or any related compliance framework.  
It applies to both internal audit activities performed by [template: organisation_name] and external audits performed by independent third parties.

## Responsibilities
The [template: CISO or Information Security Manager] is responsible for maintaining the audit schedule, coordinating audit activities, and ensuring that findings are documented and tracked to resolution.  
Department managers are responsible for cooperating with audit processes and providing the necessary evidence and documentation.  
The executive management team is responsible for reviewing audit results, approving corrective actions, and ensuring continuous improvement.  
External auditors are responsible for conducting their assessments independently, without influence or authority from [template: organisation_name].

## Internal Audits
Internal audits are performed periodically to assess whether policies, controls, and procedures are effectively implemented and operating as intended.  
They serve as an internal verification mechanism to ensure compliance with security standards, identify gaps, and confirm that corrective actions have been implemented.  

The **scope and methodology** of each internal audit must be documented and kept as systematically as possible, ensuring consistency and traceability of audit activities.  

Internal audits may include:
- Policy and document reviews  
- Control testing and validation  
- Interviews with relevant personnel  
- Examination of records, systems, and processes  

Audit frequency and scope are determined based on risk, changes in the ISMS, and management priorities.

## External Audits
External audits are performed by independent third-party organisations that have no operational authority or influence over [template: organisation_name].  
Their purpose is to objectively assess the effectiveness of the ISMS, compliance with applicable standards, and the adequacy of the implemented controls.  

The **scope and methodology** of external audits must be clearly defined, documented, and retained systematically to ensure transparency and reproducibility of results.  

External audits may include certification audits (e.g., ISO 27001) or independent assessments requested by customers, regulators, or business partners.  
These reviews provide assurance that security practices are independently validated and meet industry and regulatory expectations.

## Audit Issues & Improvements
Both internal and external audits must result in clear, documented reports identifying non-conformities, weaknesses, or areas for improvement.  
Audit findings must be reviewed by the [template: CISO or Information Security Manager] and communicated to the relevant authorities and management teams.  
Corrective and preventive actions must be implemented promptly, tracked to completion, and verified for effectiveness during subsequent reviews or audits.  
Audit results and improvement actions contribute directly to the continual improvement of the organisation’s security management program.
